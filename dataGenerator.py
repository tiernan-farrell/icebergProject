# The goal with this generated data is to ease the implementation of the cubing algorithms... 
# When we bring sqlite data in instead of this randomly generated data the transition should 
# be easy. We want to keep the structure of this data as realistic as possible. 
# Fetching from sqlite will return tuples with different kinds of data. By mocking some of these 
# tuples with integer data, we can ensure the algorithms are working without having to worry 
# about different data types until later.
