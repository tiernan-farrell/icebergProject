Frontend:
    - Figure out a layout 
    - Figure out sending different inputs to python script to run with different data sets and different algorithms
    - Allow for user input to change configs 
    - Style 
    - Displaying the data on a static page with information about the runs etc 

Backend: 
    - Normalize data return types : buc return "['*', '*', '*', '*', '*']: 100000","[0, '*', '*', '*', '*']: 14359
                                    tdc return "(0, '*', '*', '*', '*'): 14359","(0, 0, '*', '*', '*'): 2025" - Tiernan and Aaron
                                    apriori returns ['0', '*', '*', '*', '*']: 14359" - Jack 
                                    fix star cube to return list of strings like others 
        We want to have return be a list of strings of stars for aggregates and actual data types for real values:
            0 instead of '0'

    - Find a test data set (sqlite) with different types of data, different cardinality across dimensions
    - Normalizing the processing of the data from the dataset before algorithms are called. 
    - Expand data sets: We want to find data sets with varying sizes, dimensions, cardinality, etc to actually test algorithms 
    - Testing data sets and algorithms in the cloud and generating data

Whole Team: 
    - Deploying and testing code on different configurations with linode
    - What are the metrics we are using to analyze the performance 
        - Time 
        - Memory usage, cpu usage, nodes pruned
    - update README
    - Mid november progress report 
    - Final paper
    - Final video

    Backend: 
    - Normalize data return types : buc return ['*', '*', '*', '*', '*']: 100000","[0, '*', '*', '*', '*']: 14359
                                    tdc return "(0, '*', '*', '*', '*'): 14359","(0, 0, '*', '*', '*'): 2025"
                                    apriori returns ['0', '*', '*', '*', '*']: 14359"

11/16: 
    Goal: Fully functional frontend with user inputs and static results page
